Get thumbnail images of posts along with Excerpts.

== Description ==

Inspite of having found numerous plugins to get excerpts along with thumbnail images in Wordpress plugin directory. I have written this plugin to reduce number of requests that are made to MySQL database while fetching data.

Get Excerpts with Thumbnail plugin uses meta data of post, to retrieve thumbnail image. It also uses another plug-in named <a href="http://www.webspaceworks.com/resources/wordpress/44/">Cotent Extract</a> by <a href="http://www.webspaceworks.com">Rob Shumann</a>, to retrieve excerpt from POST. You need install Content Extract plugin before start working with this plugin.
